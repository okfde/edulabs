Template inheritance add-on for Liquid
===

Implementation of template inheritance, similar to what offers [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/templates/).

See the discussion with the Shopify team about it [here](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/pull/336).

**Important**. That's not a fork of the Liquid gem, it's rather a kind of add-on for Liquid. It requires a version of Liquid higher than the 3.0.0.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile, just after the one related to Liquid.

    gem 'liquid-template-inheritance'

And then execute:

    $ bundle install
